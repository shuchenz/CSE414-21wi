Th experience of using DBMS cloud service is new for me. It is more convenient to create the table, import and store the data, 
and execute the query compare with our previous experience with executing code through terminal. However, I don't feel quite satisfied 
with my experience because cloud service is relatively unstable. I have experienced a few times when I cannot login to the service or 
connect to the server with vscode. 

I think the idea of offering a DBMS as a service in a public cloud is great since it provides more people with the ability to 
compute and deal with large amount of data, which is difficult for the computing ability of a single device.
